Smart Meal Planner is a Streamlit-based web application designed to simplify meal planning by providing personalized recipe suggestions, automated meal plans, and nutritional insights. Users can sign up and log in securely, ensuring a personalized experience. The app allows users to select ingredients they have and choose between vegetarian or non-vegetarian meal options, generating a list of recommended recipes along with their nutritional breakdown. Each recipe includes calorie, protein, carb, and fat content, along with a YouTube link for easy preparation.  

The meal planner function generates meal plans for up to seven days, randomly selecting balanced meals while storing them in an SQLite database for future reference. A grocery list generator compiles missing ingredients, making shopping hassle-free. Users can analyze their nutrition intake through interactive bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts that visualize macronutrient distribution and calorie trends over multiple days.  

With a clean and intuitive interface, Smart Meal Planner ensures an effortless experience in meal organization and tracking. Future updates aim to introduce AI-powered meal optimization, additional dietary filters (such as keto and gluten-free), and enhanced security with password hashing. Whether youâ€™re looking to eat healthier, manage your diet, or simply save time in meal planning, this app provides an efficient and user-friendly solution.
